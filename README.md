# Develeap Project
### This project undertaken for Develeap that involved several tasks. <br>
I orchestrated a `Jenkins` pipeline to construct a `Docker` image based on a Dockerfile. <br>
**[Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/blob/main/Jenkinsfile)**   **[Dockerfile](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/blob/main/Dockerfile)**<br>
Additionally, I designed an application tailored for deployment monitoring through `Argocd`.<br>
**[Deployment](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/tree/main/deployment)**<br>
As an extra achievement, I've engineered a `Helm` chart and proficiently executed its installation.<br>

To enhance operational effectiveness, I streamlined infrastructure provisioning by employing `Terraform`, 
simplifying the process of duplicating clusters, roles, and policies.<br>
