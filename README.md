This project undertaken for Develeap that involved several tasks.
I orchestrated a Jenkins pipeline to construct a Docker image based on a Dockerfile.[Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/blob/main/Jenkinsfile)[Dockerfile](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/blob/main/Dockerfile)
Additionally, I designed an application tailored for deployment monitoring through Argocd.[Deployment](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/tree/main/deployment)
As an extra achievement, I've engineered a Helm chart and proficiently executed its installation.[Helm](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/tree/main/Helm)
To enhance operational effectiveness, I streamlined infrastructure provisioning by employing Terraform, 
simplifying the process of duplicating clusters, roles, and policies.[Terraform](https://github.com/Daniel-Zolo/Develeap/tree/main/Terraform)
